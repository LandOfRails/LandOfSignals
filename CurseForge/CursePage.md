**Please note:**

* The mod is still work in progress! Bugs can not be ruled out.
* We generally recommend to make a backup of the world before each update.
* Some textures are not finished yet, e.g. the "Signal selector" is currently still a katana.
* Some performance settings are not yet perfect.
* **We are always very happy to receive feedback!**

**Usage**
------------------

1. Select a signal with the "Signal selector" by right-clicking in the air. It will be placed in your inventory
2. Place the signal at the desired position
3. Place the "Signal box" in any location
4. Take the "Connector tool" and connect with a right click the box with the place signal
5. Open the GUI with a right click on the box and select the desired signal image
6. Control the signal with a redstone signal to the signal box

**Compatibility**
------------------
The mod is compatible with all existing railroad mods. This is made possible by addressing the signals with a universal
signal box. When this gets a redstone signal the displayed signal image changes. In addition, you can determine the
signal height independently, because you assemble the signals themselves / put on top of each other. Thus the height can
be adapted to e.g. [Traincraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/traincraft)
and [Zora no Densha](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/zora-no-densha), but also
to [Immersive Railroading](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-railroading)
and [Real Train Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/realtrainmod).

**Custom content**
------------------
Yes! You can create and add your own signals.

You can find a list of all available content-packs and the latest updates of already existing ones on

Please note that the mod is still quite new, so not many packs exist yet. Especially therefore we would be very happy if
you feel like creating your own pack!

### **How do I use content packs?**

**Client & Server:** After the first start the folder "landofsignals" is created in the "config" folder (``
MINECRAFT_FOLDER/config/landofsignals``). Put your signalpack in there and start the game. The pack will be loaded
automatically. Please note that both server and client must have the pack.- 1.
